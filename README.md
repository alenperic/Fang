# Text Fang/De-Fang Tool

## About The Project

Welcome to the Text Fang/De-Fang Tool repository! This simple yet powerful tool helps cybersecurity professionals and enthusiasts to safely convert URLs into a non-executable format and vice versa, directly from the browser.

De-fanging a URL transforms it into a harmless string that can be shared without triggering security tools or accidentally clicking on a malicious link. When you need the original URL for analysis or reporting, the tool can fang it back into its active form.

### Built With

This tool is built with:
- HTML
- CSS
- Vanilla JavaScript

No backend processing means it's fast, secure, and privacy-friendly.

## Usage

The tool is straightforward:
1. Enter the URL you want to de-fang or fang in the left text area.
2. Watch the converted text appear in the right text area.
3. Use the "Copy to Clipboard" button to easily copy the text for sharing or documentation purposes.
